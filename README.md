# Trajectory Planning and Control of a Non-Holonomic Platform
 This project is dedicated to the trajectory planning and control of a non-holonomic autonomous system that follows a given path while avoiding the obstacles encountered along the track. The chosen mathematical model for planning and control is implemented in MATLAB, and the simulations are analyzed.
